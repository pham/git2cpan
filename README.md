# git2cpan
Helper utility to prep a Perl CPAN module from Github onto pause.perl.org.

This script does as much as it can to help getting your CPAN module live.
It's still in progress but check for various files to make sure you got all the requirements.
Until I need to add a new module onto CPAN, this has only been tested with an existing module.
It works to an extent.
